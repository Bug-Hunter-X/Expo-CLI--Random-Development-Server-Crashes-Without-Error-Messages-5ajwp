To improve monitoring, we can add more logging within the application itself and carefully check the logs on every crash to help narrow down the issue. 
  Also, try upgrading Expo CLI and all dependencies to the latest version to rule out any incompatibility issues.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
import {Text, View} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Example of more detailed logging
    console.log('App started');
    // Add other logs to monitor various parts of your app
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Expo App</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
