While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any apparent error message in the terminal. This would happen intermittently, making development very frustrating.  The crash would manifest as the server simply stopping, requiring a manual restart with `expo start`. There were no obvious patterns to the crashes, no specific actions that seemed to trigger them, and no error logs generated by the Expo CLI itself.
